# Supabase Configuration Fix: Blob URL Issue

## Problem Description

You were getting this error when trying to transcribe audio:

```
Cannot access blob or local URLs from Edge Function. Please ensure the audio file is uploaded to a publicly accessible URL.
```

## Root Cause

The issue was in your app's fallback mechanism for audio storage:

1. **When Supabase Storage upload failed**, the app would fall back to storing recordings with local blob URLs
2. **Blob URLs** (like `blob:http://localhost:3000/abc123`) are only accessible from the same browser session
3. **Edge Functions** run on Supabase's servers and cannot access these local blob URLs
4. **When you tried to transcribe**, the Edge Function received a blob URL and rejected it

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Fallback to Blob URLs**
- Modified `RecordingInterface.tsx` to prevent storing recordings with blob URLs when upload fails
- Now shows an error message instead of creating unusable recordings

### 2. **Added URL Validation**
- Added validation in `TranscriptionModal.tsx` to check URLs before sending to Edge Function
- Prevents the error from occurring in the first place

### 3. **Visual Indicators for Invalid Recordings**
- Modified `RecordingHistory.tsx` to show which recordings have invalid URLs
- Invalid recordings are highlighted in red with warning messages
- Transcribe button is disabled for invalid recordings

### 4. **Automatic Cleanup**
- Added cleanup function to remove existing recordings with invalid URLs
- Runs automatically when the component mounts

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling & Retry Logic**
- Added specific error handling for Gemini API overload (503 errors)
- Implemented retry functionality with countdown timer
- Users can retry failed transcriptions automatically
- Better error messages for different failure scenarios

## New Retry Functionality

### **Gemini API Overload Handling**
When you get the error:
```
"Gemini API Error: The model is overloaded. Please try again later."
```

The app now:
- Shows a clear error message: "Gemini API is currently overloaded. Please try again in 1 minute."
- Displays a retry button with countdown timer
- Automatically enables retry after the suggested wait time
- Tracks retry attempts and shows retry count

### **Other Error Types Handled**
- **Rate limiting (429)**: "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait a moment before trying again."
- **Invalid requests (400)**: "Invalid request to Gemini API. Please check your audio file and try again."
- **Authentication errors (401)**: "Gemini API authentication failed. Please check your API key."
- **Permission errors (403)**: "Access denied to Gemini API. Please check your API permissions."

## Files Modified

- `src/components/RecordingInterface.tsx` - Removed fallback to blob URLs
- `src/components/TranscriptionModal.tsx` - Added URL validation and retry logic
- `src/components/RecordingHistory.tsx` - Added visual indicators and disabled buttons
- `src/data/predefinedPrompts.ts` - Fixed syntax errors
- `supabase/functions/gemini-transcribe/index.ts` - Enhanced error handling

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Clear your browser's localStorage** to remove any existing recordings with blob URLs
2. **Try recording and saving** a new audio file
3. **Check that it uploads to Supabase Storage** successfully
4. **Try transcribing** the new recording - it should work now
5. **Test retry functionality** by simulating API overload (the retry button will appear)

## Prevention

- The app no longer creates recordings with blob URLs
- All new recordings must be successfully uploaded to Supabase Storage
- Invalid URLs are automatically detected and prevented
- Users can retry failed transcriptions with clear feedback

## If You Still Have Issues

1. **Check your Supabase Storage configuration**:
   - Ensure the `audio-recordings` bucket exists
   - Verify storage policies are set correctly
   - Check that your environment variables are set

2. **Check your Supabase Edge Function**:
   - Ensure `gemini-transcribe` function is deployed
   - Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is set

3. **Check browser console** for any upload errors

4. **For Gemini API overload**:
   - Wait for the suggested retry time
   - Use the retry button that appears
   - Check if the issue persists after multiple retries

## Storage Policy Requirements

Make sure your Supabase Storage has these policies for the `audio-recordings` bucket:

- **INSERT**: Users can upload to their own folder
- **SELECT**: Users can view their own files  
- **DELETE**: Users can delete their own files

The policies should use: `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`

## Summary

The main issue was that your app was creating recordings with blob URLs when storage uploads failed. These blob URLs cannot be accessed by Edge Functions, causing the transcription to fail. 

The fix ensures that:
- Only valid Supabase Storage URLs are stored
- Invalid URLs are detected and prevented
- Users get clear feedback about what's happening
- Existing invalid recordings are cleaned up automatically
- **Users can retry failed transcriptions with proper error handling**

Your Supabase configuration is actually correct - the issue was in the app's error handling, not in Supabase itself.
