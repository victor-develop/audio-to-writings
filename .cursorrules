# Cursor Rules for AI-Day Project

## üö´ **NO localStorage Usage Without Explicit Permission**

### **Rule: localStorage is FORBIDDEN by default**

**DO NOT use localStorage, sessionStorage, or any browser storage mechanisms unless explicitly requested by the user.**

### **What This Means:**

1. **Never suggest localStorage** for data persistence
2. **Never implement localStorage** for storing user data
3. **Never use localStorage** for caching or state management
4. **Always use Supabase** for data storage and persistence

### **Allowed Storage Methods:**

‚úÖ **Supabase Database** - For all user data, recordings, prompts, etc.
‚úÖ **Supabase Storage** - For audio files and media
‚úÖ **React State** - For temporary UI state
‚úÖ **URL Parameters** - For navigation state
‚úÖ **Cookies** - Only for authentication tokens (handled by Supabase)

### **When localStorage MIGHT be allowed:**

- User explicitly asks for localStorage
- User wants offline-only functionality
- User wants browser-specific features
- User explicitly overrides this rule

### **Examples of FORBIDDEN localStorage usage:**

‚ùå `localStorage.setItem('recordings', JSON.stringify(data))`
‚ùå `const data = localStorage.getItem('userPreferences')`
‚ùå `sessionStorage.setItem('tempData', value)`
‚ùå Any browser storage for user content

### **Examples of REQUIRED Supabase usage:**

‚úÖ `supabase.from('recordings').insert(data)`
‚úÖ `supabase.storage.from('audio').upload(path, file)`
‚úÖ `supabase.from('user_prompts').select('*')`

### **Why This Rule Exists:**

1. **Data Persistence** - localStorage doesn't persist across devices
2. **User Isolation** - localStorage doesn't support multi-user apps
3. **Backup & Recovery** - localStorage data can be lost
4. **Professional Standards** - Production apps use proper databases
5. **Security** - localStorage has no built-in security

### **Enforcement:**

- **Always suggest Supabase alternatives**
- **Explain why localStorage is inappropriate**
- **Provide Supabase implementation examples**
- **Never implement localStorage without explicit permission**

### **If User Requests localStorage:**

1. **Ask for clarification** on why they need it
2. **Suggest Supabase alternatives** that solve their real problem
3. **Explain the limitations** of localStorage
4. **Only implement if they explicitly override this rule**

---

**Remember: Supabase is the ONLY storage solution for this project unless explicitly overridden by the user.**
