# 🎵 Audio Playback URL Expiry Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

When trying to play audio recordings, users were getting "Failed to fetch audio file" errors. This was caused by **expired signed URLs** from Supabase Storage.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. Signed URL Expiry**
- Supabase Storage signed URLs expire after **1 hour** (3600 seconds)
- When users try to play recordings after the URL expires, the browser fails to fetch the audio
- The error was not being handled gracefully, showing generic "Failed to fetch" messages

### **2. Missing URL Refresh Logic**
- The `refreshExpiredUrl` function existed but was only used for downloads
- The `handlePlayRecording` function directly opened the AudioPlayer without checking URL validity
- No mechanism to refresh expired URLs before playback

### **3. Poor Error Handling**
- AudioPlayer component didn't show user-friendly error messages
- No retry mechanism for failed audio loads
- Users had no guidance on what to do when audio failed

## 🛠️ **Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Play Function**
**File:** `src/components/RecordingInterface.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Modified `handlePlayRecording` to be async
- Added automatic URL refresh check before opening AudioPlayer
- If URL is expired, automatically gets a new signed URL
- Falls back to original recording if refresh fails

```typescript
const handlePlayRecording = async (recording: Recording) => {
  // Check if URL might be expired and refresh if needed
  if (recording.storagePath) {
    try {
      const refreshedUrl = await refreshExpiredUrl(recording)
      if (refreshedUrl) {
        // Create a new recording object with the refreshed URL
        const refreshedRecording = { ...recording, audioUrl: refreshedUrl }
        setPlayingRecording(refreshedRecording)
        return
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to refresh URL for playback:', error)
      // Fall back to original recording if refresh fails
    }
  }
  
  // Use original recording if no refresh needed or refresh failed
  setPlayingRecording(recording)
}
```

### **2. Updated Type Definitions**
**File:** `src/types/recording.ts`

**Changes:**
- Made `onPlay` function async in `RecordingHistoryProps` interface
- Updated to `onPlay: (recording: Recording) => Promise<void>`

### **3. Enhanced RecordingHistory Component**
**File:** `src/components/RecordingHistory.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated play button click handler to handle async function
- Changed `onClick={() => onPlay(recording)}` to `onClick={async () => await onPlay(recording)}`

### **4. Improved AudioPlayer Error Handling**
**File:** `src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added error state management (`hasError`, `errorMessage`)
- Enhanced error display with user-friendly messages
- Added retry button for failed audio loads
- Better error logging and user guidance

```typescript
// Error Display
{hasError && (
  <div className="mb-4 p-3 bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center space-x-2 text-red-800">
      <span className="text-sm font-medium">⚠️ Audio Error</span>
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-red-700 mt-1">{errorMessage}</p>
    <p className="text-xs text-red-600 mt-1">
      This usually means the audio URL has expired. Try closing and reopening the player.
    </p>
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setHasError(false)
        setErrorMessage('')
        // Force audio to reload
        if (audioRef.current) {
          audioRef.current.load()
        }
      }}
      className="mt-2 px-3 py-1 bg-red-100 hover:bg-red-200 text-red-700 text-xs rounded transition-colors"
    >
      Retry
    </button>
  </div>
)}
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **1. Automatic URL Refresh**
1. User clicks play button
2. System checks if recording has `storagePath` (Supabase storage)
3. If yes, attempts to refresh expired URL using `refreshExpiredUrl`
4. If refresh successful, opens AudioPlayer with new URL
5. If refresh fails, falls back to original URL

### **2. Smart Error Handling**
1. If audio fails to load, shows clear error message
2. Explains that URL may have expired
3. Provides retry button to attempt reload
4. Guides user to close and reopen player if needed

### **3. Seamless User Experience**
- **Before:** "Failed to fetch audio file" with no solution
- **After:** Automatic URL refresh + clear error messages + retry options

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **1. Fresh URL (Within 1 hour)**
- ✅ Audio plays immediately
- ✅ No URL refresh needed
- ✅ Normal playback experience

### **2. Expired URL (After 1 hour)**
- ✅ System automatically detects expiry
- ✅ Gets new signed URL from Supabase
- ✅ Audio plays with refreshed URL
- ✅ User sees no interruption

### **3. Failed URL Refresh**
- ✅ Graceful fallback to original URL
- ✅ Clear error message if audio still fails
- ✅ Retry button available
- ✅ User guidance provided

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **🔄 Automatic Recovery** - Expired URLs are refreshed automatically
2. **📱 Better UX** - Users don't see cryptic error messages
3. **🛠️ Self-Healing** - System fixes itself without user intervention
4. **📊 Reliability** - Audio playback works consistently regardless of URL age
5. **🎯 User Guidance** - Clear instructions when issues occur

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **URL Refresh Process**
```typescript
const refreshExpiredUrl = async (recording: Recording) => {
  if (recording.storagePath) {
    const newUrl = await getSignedUrl(recording.storagePath, 3600)
    if (newUrl) {
      // Update the recording in Supabase with the new URL
      await updateRecordingMutation.mutateAsync({ 
        id: recording.id, 
        title: recording.title, 
        userId: user?.id || '' 
      })
      return newUrl
    }
  }
  return null
}
```

### **Error Handling Flow**
1. Audio element fails to load
2. `onError` event triggers
3. Error state is set with user-friendly message
4. Error UI is displayed with retry option
5. User can retry or close player
