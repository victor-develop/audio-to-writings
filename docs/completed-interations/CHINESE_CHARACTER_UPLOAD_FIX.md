# Chinese Character Upload Fix

## Problem
When trying to save recordings with Chinese characters in the title, you were getting:
```
Failed to upload audio: invalid key
```

This happens because Supabase Storage has restrictions on file names with special characters, including Chinese characters.

## Root Cause
Supabase Storage uses the filename as part of the storage key, and certain characters (including Chinese characters) are not allowed in storage keys.

## Solution Implemented

### **1. Safe Filename Generation**
- **Before**: Used user input directly as filename → caused "invalid key" error
- **After**: Generate safe filenames using datetime format: `recording_20241220_143052.webm`

### **2. Two-Step Process**
1. **Upload**: Use safe filename for storage (e.g., `recording_20241220_143052.webm`)
2. **Display**: Use user-friendly title (e.g., "我的录音" - Chinese characters allowed)

### **3. Filename Format**
```
recording_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.ext
```
- `recording_` - prefix for easy identification
- `20241220` - date (YYYYMMDD)
- `143052` - time (HHMMSS)
- `.webm` - file extension

## Files Modified

### **`src/hooks/useSupabaseStorage.ts`**
- Added `storagePath` to `UploadResult` interface
- Changed filename generation from user input to datetime-based
- Safe filenames ensure successful uploads

### **`src/components/RecordingInterface.tsx`**
- Updated to handle new upload result structure
- Added logging for storage path used
- Maintains user-friendly titles for display

## How It Works Now

### **Upload Process:**
1. User enters title: "我的录音" (Chinese characters)
2. System generates safe filename: `recording_20241220_143052.webm`
3. File uploads successfully to Supabase Storage
4. Recording saved with user-friendly title "我的录音"
5. Storage uses safe filename, display uses user title

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Chinese characters work** in titles
- ✅ **Uploads succeed** with safe storage keys
- ✅ **User experience maintained** - titles look exactly as entered
- ✅ **Unique filenames** prevent conflicts
- ✅ **Easy debugging** with timestamp-based names

## Example

**User Input:**
- Title: "会议记录 - 产品讨论"
- Duration: 2 minutes

**What Happens:**
1. Safe filename generated: `recording_20241220_143052.webm`
2. File uploads to: `userId/recording_20241220_143052.webm`
3. Recording displays as: "会议记录 - 产品讨论"
4. Storage key is safe, title is user-friendly

## Testing

1. **Try recording with Chinese title** - should work now
2. **Check console logs** - you'll see the safe storage path used
3. **Verify display** - title should show exactly as you entered it
4. **Check storage** - file should be accessible via the generated URL

## Future Enhancements

If you want true file renaming capability:
- Implement download → re-upload with new name → delete old file
- This would allow changing the actual storage filename after upload
- For now, the current solution provides the best user experience

## Summary

The fix ensures that:
- **Storage keys are always safe** (ASCII characters only)
- **User titles can contain any UTF-8 characters** (Chinese, emojis, etc.)
- **Uploads succeed** without "invalid key" errors
- **User experience is preserved** with friendly titles
- **System is robust** and handles special characters gracefully
